`pageviews` provides data from the new Wikimedia RESTful API for pageview data. It allows you to retrieve per-article, per-project, and top-1000 pageview data covering a wide range of times and with filtering around the user's class and platform.

## Installation
The package is being submitted to CRAN as we speak; in the meantime:

    devtools::install_github("ironholds/pageviews", ref = "0.1.0")
